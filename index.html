    <h2>Information</h2>  
    <p>JGL Technologies is a place where we design, produce and sell. We create things like atmega devboards, 6502 like processer boards, raw logic circuits and pretty much any circuit you can think of. We sell items on our ebay store. The first product we are selling is a JGL Uno. It is arduino compatible, and it also uses 3.3v logic levels so it is easy to interface with things like a tft lcd, a sim card module and many more. We are looking to making so many more devices in the future. The person who designs and builds these items is Joseph Gaetano Luca. Joe is the the person who founded JGL Technologies. Our CFO/Network Admin goes by the name of George Delmar Luca. That was a little bit of information about JGL Technologies and its community. We hope you buy our products in the future!</p>
